Many of us find it hard to work with a degree of focus and get stuff done. This is no oneâ€™s fault â€“ this is simply is a natural result of training ourselves to respond to any interruption â€“ rather than training ourselves to remain focused.Â  This connectedMINDS journey will help you establish 3-4 key habits of focus in your working day, so that you have a feeling of being able to concentrate and work with efficacy. Through your own experience, you will deepen your understanding of how you can influence the basic physiological networks that underpin your ability to focus.

Many of us find it hard to work with a degree of focus and get stuff done. This is no oneâ€™s fault â€“ this is simply is a natural result of training ourselves to respond to any interruption â€“ rather than training ourselves to remain focused.Â  This connectedMINDS journey will help you establish 3-4 key habits of focus in your working day, so that you have a feeling of being able to concentrate and work with efficacy. Through your own experience, you will deepen your understanding of how you can influence the basic physiological networks that underpin your ability to focus.

We have a constant barrage of e-mails, yammer and MS Teams messages, calls and other work related interruptions. This is coupled with the digital distractions from our devices. Many of us find it hard to work with a degree of focus and get stuff done. This is no oneâ€™s fault â€“ this is simply is a natural result of training ourselves to respond to any interruption â€“ rather than training ourselves to remain focused.Â  This connectedMINDS journey will help you establish 3-4 key habits of focus in your working day, so that you have a feeling of being able to concentrate and work with efficacy. Through your own experience, you will deepen your understanding of how you can influence the basic physiological networks that underpin your ability to focus. In the two weeks of the program we will be focusing on core skills and how to anchor new habits.Â  -Sessions 1-2: Basics: Understanding attention and the role of mindfulness in …","Description_sufficient":"0.0","Reason_if_insufficient":"other","Number of words in Description":"170","NVS_Course_Description_length":"1005","similarity":"0","is_complete":"0","_deepnote_index_column":"0"},{"NVS_Training_Object_ID":"a816c41e-4a5b-425f-b334-01c6c86ff2b2","NVS_Training_Action":"Keep","NVS_Course_Training_Provider":"SANDOZ","NVS_Course_Training_Title_x":"SDZ BCD_High Impact Meeting Facilitation","NVS_Course_Description_x":"High Impact Meeting Facilitation Training for Sandoz","Description_sufficient":"0.0","Reason_if_insufficient":"missing relevance","Number of words in Description":"7","NVS_Course_Description_length":"52","similarity":"67","is_complete":"0","_deepnote_index_column":"9"},{"NVS_Training_Object_ID":"d307a09a-7297-4b3c-93d5-004765472a54","NVS_Training_Action":"Keep","NVS_Course_Training_Provider":"Corporate Functions","NVS_Course_Training_Title_x":"1.

This is no oneâ€™s fault â€“ this is simply is a natural result of training ourselves to respond to any interruption â€“ rather than training ourselves to remain focused.Â  This connectedMINDS journey will help you establish 3-4 key habits of focus in your working day, so that you have a feeling of being able to concentrate and work with efficacy.
