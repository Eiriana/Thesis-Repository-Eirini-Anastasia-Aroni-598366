To begin with, the notebook "1. Subset Creation.ipynb" contains the code related to the filtering of the dataset in order to create the subset considered for the analysis. 
Following, notebooks "2. Logistic Regression & Feature Engineering.ipynb". and "3. Pre-trained BERT Model.ipynb" present the machine learning models performance. 
The dataset used for the anlaysis can be found in the file "merged_df_final.csv". The latter is essentially the subset created in the first notebook after the professionals in the company labelled the sample of records as explained in the main text of the thesis and all records missing description are dropped. 
In addition, the notebook "4. Description Length Assessment.ipynb" presents the improvements in description length of the records in the test group. 
Last but not least, the notebook "5. Consumption Assessment.ipynb" contains the difference in difference regression in order to examine if the intervention has a significant effect on weekly consumption. The consumption dataset used for the regression can be found in the file "new_regression_df.csv"
