We have a constant barrage of e-mails, yammer and MS Teams messages, calls and other work related interruptions. This is coupled with the digital distractions from our devices. Many of us find it hard to work with a degree of focus and get stuff done. This is no oneâ€™s fault â€“ this is simply is a natural result of training ourselves to respond to any interruption â€“ rather than training ourselves to remain focused.Â  This connectedMINDS journey will help you establish 3-4 key habits of focus in your working day, so that you have a feeling of being able to concentrate and work with efficacy. Through your own experience, you will deepen your understanding of how you can influence the basic physiological networks that underpin your ability to focus. In the two weeks of the program we will be focusing on core skills and how to anchor new habits.Â  -Sessions 1-2: Basics: Understanding attention and the role of mindfulness in streng",no,other

Neuroscience, findings enable us to better understand how our mental and emotional make-up is affected by our experiences and how these impact our physical, mental, and social wellbeing. They also provide insights into the mechanisms of mindfulness like attention and emotion regulation and self-awareness and how these help us to better regulate ourselves. In this series, we explore how mindfulness can help us to better understand our complex minds and cultivate qualities that are inherent and helpful for us in our lives.

For his book, Leadership Charisma’, Deiric McCann undertook the largest ever study on what makes leaders charismatic – taking input from more than 400,000 people on their 40,000+ leaders.  That research showed clearly that charisma is all about how you ‘show up’ – and that anyone can improve the impact they have on those around them, simply by becoming more mindful and emotionally intelligent about how they behave with those they wish to influence. If charisma is a God given gift, then it’s given to all who care to accept it. In this brief talk, Deiric will outline the core findings of this research, and provide some immediate actions you can take to change your impact on those around you.",,

Course description

IHME’s database contains epidemiology and disease burden measures for 204 countries and territories as well as subnational data for many locations. Incidence, prevalence, mortality and burden metrics (YLDs, YLLs, DALYs) are measured for 3,000+ diseases, injuries and sequela across time and by age and sex. 
This 45min training will provide a deeper understanding of the summary burden metrics in the GBD and how to interpret them, as well as describe additional data sets that help describe the population – such as covariates, the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ Index), and the Socio-demographic index (SDI).

- Create a strong shared perspective and drive to value using personas and problem scenarios
- Diagnose what software to develop and why using a set of agile user stories and prototypes
- Facilitate narrative collaboration with user stories and prototypes

supporting them as they reflect on their approach and how they can harness their strengths in new ways to
meet emerging customer needs.
This coaching guide provides an overview of key concepts shared in the modules and some meaningful
questions to assist you in helping specialists synthesize and crystallize their ideas and insights.

complete the self-directed learning modules prior to starting your coaching sessions so that you have the
same context as specialists. In lieu of that, this guide should still provide enough information about what the

It is in a certain way the opposite of a culture of people acting with an inspired, curious, unbossed attitude underpinned by integrity.  Neuroscience, psychology, and behavior science findings enable us to better understand how our mental and emotional make-up is affected by our experiences and how these impact our physical, mental, and social wellbeing.

Neuroscience, findings enable us to better understand how our mental and emotional make-up is affected by our experiences and how these impact our physical, mental, and social wellbeing. They also provide insights into the mechanisms of mindfulness like attention and emotion regulation and self-awareness and how these help us to better regulate ourselves.

Knowledge is transferred from the agent to the customer in the process of fixing their problem. 
 
Unfortunately, many customer support interactions are very repetitive, and agents are continually responding to requests that could have been better solved with documentation. In many teams, this documentation doesn't exist, and support agents must respond to every customer from scratch. 
Not to fear – this is where Knowledge-Centered Services (KCS) comes in. 
 
Knowledge-Centered Services is a response to the firefighting mode of customer support delivery desks. Knowledge is preserved for the benefit of future team members and customers as each new customer request is documented while the fix is being delivered.

Neuroscience, findings enable us to better understand how our mental and emotional make-up is affected by our experiences and how these impact our physical, mental, and social wellbeing. They also provide insights into the mechanisms of mindfulness like attention and emotion regulation and self-awareness and how these help us to better regulate ourselves.

Neuroscience, findings enable us to better understand how our mental and emotional make-up is affected by our experiences and how these impact our physical, mental, and social wellbeing. They also provide insights into the mechanisms of mindfulness like attention and emotion regulation and self-awareness and how these help us to better regulate ourselves. In this series, we explore how mindfulness can help us to better understand our complex minds and cultivate qualities that are inherent and helpful for us in our lives.

Knowledge is transferred from the agent to the customer in the process of fixing their problem. 
 
Unfortunately, many customer support interactions are very repetitive, and agents are continually responding to requests that could have been better solved with documentation. In many teams, this documentation doesn't exist, and support agents must respond to every customer from scratch. 
Not to fear – this is where Knowledge-Centered Services (KCS) comes in. 
 
Knowledge-Centered Services is a response to the firefighting mode of customer support delivery desks. Knowledge is preserved for the benefit of future team members and customers as each new customer request is documented while the fix is being delivered.

To market a gene therapy product for use in humans, the gene therapy product has to be tested for safety and effectiveness so that we can evaluate whether the risks of the therapy are acceptable in light of the benefits. Gene therapy holds the promise to transform medicine and create options for patients who are living with difficult, and even incurable, diseases.
